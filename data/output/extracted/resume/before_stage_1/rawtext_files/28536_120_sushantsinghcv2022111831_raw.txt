PROJECT DETAILS

 

Project Name: Each One Fix One

In our own way, we deliver on Kaizens/process improvements that eliminate the reason for a
customer reaching out to us. Future is all about pre-empting a customer need and fixing an issue
even before it arises. We refer one customer issue to eliminate root cause such that the same issue
never reoccurs for any customer. We have done 17 changes in current process under this project.
Also received GLOBAL AWARDS for Excellence in Quality Management & Leadership 2018 — BEST
CUSTOMER SERVICE INITIATIVE PROJECT EACH ONE FIX ONE.

Development: RSA (Road Side Assistance)

Concern- Increase RSA (Road Side Assistance) issues due to lack of awareness within customers.
Fix- Dispatch of RSA stickers (with AGA Toll free number) along with policy booklet enabling
customers to paste on vehicle windshield for easy recall and quick assistance. Highlight the toll-free
number of RSA on our website as well. As RSA has been provided by our tied-up partner AGA and
customers were not aware of this and they used to contact our organisation for urgent help and
then got our partners contact details. So, we need to make the awareness of partners details to our
customers so that they can contact directly to our partner and take urgent help which we did
successfully with above mentioned changes in current process.
